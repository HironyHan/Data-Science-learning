1.NP-hard problem
  relationship with NP problem
  what is NP problem and P problem
  what is the relationship between P problem and Polynomial Time

2.Sparse Regression
  usually using Lasso(L1), Ridge(L2), Stepwise Regression(suprisingly) and Forward Selection, etc.
  Tell the difference between L1 and L2: They are deployed as a punishment to avoid the model become too complex and overfitting. 
    L1 = λ * Σ|θi|; L2 = λ * Σθi^2. L1 can reduce some θ to 0, which is useful to feature selection in high-dimension data. L2 reduce all the θ but not to 0 (Becuase the more close to 0, reduce the same value means less reduce the amount.--the shape of exponential function).
    L2 help the model's robustness when facing multicollinearity.

3.Genetic Algorithm 
  Simulating the biology genetic steps. Always choosing the most adaptable individuals and also introducing Mutation for diversity. Repeating the steps until max interate times and getting the results.

4.Get use of Eureqa software
  Not open source right now. Looking for resources.
